The Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is an approach to training 
a deep convolutional neural network for image-to-image translation in three steps:

  * load and prepare the satellite image to Google maps image-to-image translation dataset,
  * develop a Pix2Pix model for translating satellite photographs to Google map images,
  * use the final Pix2Pix generator model to translate ad hoc satellite images.
